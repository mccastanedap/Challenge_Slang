This program fetches data from a REST API at a given enpoint and consumes a list of
activites for an arbitrary amount of users. It then parses the JSON
file to create a dictionary of user ids and their groups their respective sessions from the list of
their activities if the time between activities exceeds 5 minutes the activites are different user sessions.
